//Given a sorted array and a number x, find the pair in array whose sum is closest to x

/*Solution - 
We will maintain two indexes one at beginning (l=0) and one at end (r=n-1)
iterate until l <  r
Calculate diff as arr[l] + arr[r]-x
if abs (diff) < minDiff then update the minimum sum and pair.
If arr[l] + arr[r] is less than X, this means if we want to find sum close to X, do râ€“
If arr[l] + arr[r] is greater than 0,this means if we want to find sum close to X , do l++
